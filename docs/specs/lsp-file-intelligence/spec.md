# LSP File Intelligence

## Why

Users inspect and edit code inside Kandev task file tabs, but code navigation and analysis otherwise require opening an external editor. Lightweight language-server intelligence lets users understand a project without leaving the task.

## What

- Desktop Monaco file editors can connect to Language Server Protocol servers for:
  - TypeScript and JavaScript via `typescript-language-server`
  - Python via `pyright-langserver`
  - Go via `gopls`
  - Rust via `rust-analyzer`
  - Kotlin via the official `kotlin-lsp`; Kotlin is marked experimental while its upstream server is alpha
- Wired editor capabilities are diagnostics, completions, hover, go to definition, references, signature help, and semantic tokens.
- Global editor settings select languages that auto-start, languages Kandev may auto-install, and per-language configuration returned through `workspace/configuration`.
- A user can manually start or stop the current file's server from the file toolbar. Manual state is remembered in browser local storage for that session and language.
- The current editor's LSP status surface distinguishes process launch, protocol readiness, and server-reported project work:
  - after the task host reports `ready`, it says that the server process started and that Kandev is waiting for the LSP `initialize` response;
  - while initialization is pending, it shows locally measured elapsed time without treating that time as server-reported indexing progress;
  - after 60 seconds without an initialize response, it says initialization is taking longer than usual, keeps the connection alive, and retains the Stop action;
  - Kotlin's long-running state explains that Kotlin LSP may be importing a Gradle project and that cross-file features remain unavailable until initialization completes, without promising an ETA;
  - when the server reports standard LSP work-done progress, it shows the server title, optional message, optional percentage, elapsed time, and the number of concurrent work items;
  - when the server reports no work progress, it says so instead of inventing an indexing state, percentage, or time remaining.
- The LSP status location is a portable editor preference:
  - `toolbar` is the default and keeps the control beside the current Monaco editor's actions;
  - `status_bar` moves the active Monaco editor's control and live summary into the application status bar when that feature is enabled on a fine-pointer layout;
  - if the application status bar is disabled or the layout uses a coarse pointer, Kandev falls back to the editor toolbar without overwriting the saved preference;
  - the status-bar item follows only the active Monaco file's session and language and is not a global dashboard of every live server.
- The effective status control remains disclosure-first:
  - fine-pointer toolbar and status-bar controls open the same anchored progress popover;
  - coarse-pointer Monaco layouts use the toolbar and open an inset bottom drawer with the same status, progress, and Start, Stop, or Retry action;
  - phone file viewing remains LSP-free and does not render the control.
- A connected server remains connected while project work is active. Progress never replaces the ready connection state or disables document synchronization and editor providers.
- Progress copy warns that cross-file results may be incomplete while server-reported analysis is active. Completion means only that the reported work item ended; it does not guarantee that every reference, dependency, or project module is resolved.
- Kotlin supports auto-start but not auto-install. `kotlin-lsp` must already be available on the task host's `PATH`.
- Language servers run through the task's `agentctl`, with the task workspace as their working directory. This keeps project files, dependencies, and server execution in the same environment.
- V1 task-host support is limited to Local PC and local Docker executors. Remote Docker, SSH, and Sprites report an unsupported-executor state.
- Each active browser WebSocket owns one language-server process. The browser shares a connection for the same session and language inside one window and closes it after its idle timeout; separate browser windows may own separate processes.
- The backend caps active LSP WebSocket connections at 8 by default. `KANDEV_LSP_MAX_CONNECTIONS` overrides the cap.
- Language-server processes and npm/Go auto-install commands are owned by the existing agentctl process manager. Instance teardown cancels and drains install work, then reaps full process trees on Unix and Windows before releasing resources.
- Kandev-managed npm and release binaries live under the task host's `~/.kandev/lsp-servers`; `gopls` is installed through the task host's Go toolchain. No managed server cache lives inside a checked-out project.
- LSP JSON-RPC bodies are limited to 16 MiB across stdio and WebSocket transport; stdio headers are bounded separately. Oversized frames close the affected connection instead of allocating unbounded memory.
- Mobile file viewing does not start language servers in the background.

## User settings

Existing user-setting fields are the durable global policy:

| JSON field                   | Type                    | Meaning                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lsp_auto_start_languages`   | `string[]`              | Languages that connect when a matching file opens.                                                                              |
| `lsp_auto_install_languages` | `string[]`              | Languages Kandev may install when their server binary is missing. Kotlin is rejected because it requires manual installation.   |
| `lsp_server_configs`         | `object`                | Per-language JSON returned to the server through `workspace/configuration`.                                                     |
| `lsp_status_location`        | `toolbar \| status_bar` | Preferred LSP status surface. Missing or invalid values normalize to `toolbar`; runtime capability fallbacks do not rewrite it. |

There is no durable per-task or per-session LSP policy in V1. Manual toolbar state is browser-local and does not override another browser window.

## API surface

### Browser-facing stream

`GET /lsp/:sessionId?language=<language>`

The main backend resolves or restores the task execution, checks executor support and global capacity, authenticates to that execution's agentctl instance, and proxies WebSocket frames.

### Task-host stream

`GET /api/v1/lsp/stream?language=<language>&autoInstall=<bool>`

This authenticated agentctl route resolves or installs the binary, starts it in the task workspace, converts WebSocket JSON messages to LSP stdio framing, and converts LSP stdio responses back to WebSocket messages.

Before JSON-RPC traffic begins, the task-host stream can emit:

```json
{ "status": "installing", "language": "python" }
{ "status": "installed", "language": "python" }
{ "status": "ready", "workspacePath": "/abs/task/worktree" }
{ "status": "install_failed", "language": "python", "error": "..." }
```

Application close codes are:

| Code   | Meaning                                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `4001` | Server binary missing and auto-install is unavailable or disabled. |
| `4002` | Session, execution, or agentctl stream unavailable.                |
| `4003` | Auto-install failed.                                               |
| `4004` | Executor unsupported in V1.                                        |
| `4005` | Active LSP connection cap reached.                                 |

### Browser LSP progress contract

The browser advertises standard LSP `window.workDoneProgress` support and includes a client-generated `workDoneToken` in `initialize`. This lets servers such as JetBrains Kotlin LSP report project-import phases before the initialize response.

The browser accepts both server-created progress tokens through `window/workDoneProgress/create` and `$/progress` notifications for the initialize token. Tokens can be strings or numbers and are scoped to one browser-owned session, language, and connection generation.

Supported work-done payloads are:

| Kind     | Observable behavior                                                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `begin`  | Adds or replaces the token with its title, message, optional percentage, and local start time.   |
| `report` | Updates only the matching active token; an omitted percentage preserves its last reported value. |
| `end`    | Removes only the matching active token and records the server's optional completion message.     |

Percentages are clamped to 0–100 for presentation. Unknown tokens, malformed payloads, and late notifications from a replaced connection are ignored.

No backend or task-host payload transforms are required: both WebSocket proxy hops transport the JSON-RPC body unchanged.

## Readiness and progress state

- Connection readiness remains the existing lifecycle (`connecting`, `installing`, `starting`, `ready`, `stopping`, `unavailable`, or `error`).
- The task-host `ready` handshake means the executable has launched and the JSON-RPC bridge can begin; it does not mean the language server has completed LSP initialization.
- Initialization is locally observable from the initialize request until its response. The UI shows elapsed time even when the server sends no progress payload.
- The 60-second long-running presentation is derived only from elapsed wall time. It does not change connection state, cancel the request, restart the server, or assert that the server is indexing.
- Work-done progress is runtime-only activity attached to a live connection. Multiple active tokens are a flat list because LSP defines no parent/child relationship.
- The oldest active work item is the primary summary; additional active items are shown as a count. Percentages from unrelated work items are never averaged.
- The most recently ended item can remain visible as “server-reported work finished” for the lifetime of that connection. It is not described as project-wide success.
- Stop, idle disconnect, crash, socket close, connection replacement, and retry clear all active and completed progress. A replacement generation starts with no inherited work state.
- Progress activity is scoped to the current editor's session and language. It is not a global task-wide language-server dashboard.

## State and persistence

- User settings persist in the existing user-settings store.
- Manual enablement persists only in browser local storage under the session and language.
- Processes, open documents, diagnostics, and semantic-token caches are runtime-only.
- A missing server starts only when a supported file is opened and auto-start or a toolbar action requests it.
- Closing the browser connection stops its process; stopping the task reaps every owned language-server process even if a browser connection remains open.

## Failure modes

- **Unsupported executor:** the file toolbar reports that the task host is unsupported and no process starts.
- **Missing Kotlin server:** the UI tells the user to install `kotlin-lsp` on the task host; it does not offer or retry auto-install.
- **Missing auto-installable server:** the UI reports the missing binary or shows install progress when auto-install is enabled.
- **Capacity exceeded:** the UI reports that too many language servers are active.
- **Server crash:** the connection closes, Monaco providers and markers are cleaned up, and the user can retry.
- **No progress support or reports:** initialization still shows an indeterminate state and elapsed time; after initialize succeeds, the status surface says the server has not reported background analysis progress.
- **Initialize response is slow or never arrives:** the UI confirms that the process launched, changes to a long-running initialization warning after 60 seconds, and keeps Stop available. Kandev does not automatically kill a cold project import or claim that the server is indexing.
- **Indeterminate progress:** the UI shows the server title/message and elapsed time without a percentage or ETA.
- **Malformed or stale progress:** the client ignores the payload and preserves the current connection and valid work items.
- **Cross-file intelligence remains incomplete after ready:** the UI does not claim that the server is still indexing unless a work item is active; the status surface explains that project import, dependencies, or module resolution may require investigation.
- **Task stop:** agentctl closes process admission and reaps the language-server process tree before releasing task resources.
- **Instance teardown during auto-install:** agentctl cancels the install, removes an unpublished partial release download, drains the shared cache mutation, and reaps npm/Go descendants before releasing task resources.
- **Unknown language:** no LSP control is shown.

## Scenarios

- **GIVEN** Kotlin auto-start is enabled and `kotlin-lsp` is on a Local PC task host's `PATH`, **WHEN** a `.kt` or `.kts` file opens, **THEN** the toolbar reaches ready and Monaco registers Kotlin providers.
- **GIVEN** `kotlin-lsp` is missing, **WHEN** Kotlin LSP starts, **THEN** the connection closes with `4001` and the UI shows manual setup guidance without attempting installation.
- **GIVEN** a local Docker task, **WHEN** an LSP starts, **THEN** the binary is resolved and executed inside the container rather than on the main backend host.
- **GIVEN** an SSH, Sprites, or remote-Docker task, **WHEN** a user starts LSP, **THEN** the UI reports an unsupported executor and no process starts.
- **GIVEN** the configured connection cap is reached, **WHEN** another editor starts LSP, **THEN** the new connection closes with `4005`.
- **GIVEN** two task/session connections have active providers, placeholder models, or diagnostics, **WHEN** one connection stops or crashes, **THEN** cleanup removes only that connection's state and leaves the other connection fully functional.
- **GIVEN** two sessions expose the same task-host file URI (for example two Docker tasks rooted at `/workspace`), **WHEN** both files are open, **THEN** Monaco keeps session-scoped models and content while both language servers receive the clean task-host URI.
- **GIVEN** a connection is replaced for the same session and language, **WHEN** callbacks from the old connection arrive late, **THEN** they cannot close, initialize, or clean up the replacement generation.
- **GIVEN** session workspace metadata hydrates after the LSP connection, **WHEN** the client opens or navigates to a document, **THEN** it uses the canonical workspace URI and repository subpaths from the task-host ready handshake, including after that LSP connection stops.
- **GIVEN** a definition or reference target is nested beneath unloaded folders, **WHEN** Monaco navigates to that file, **THEN** the Files tree loads and expands every ancestor and marks the target as active.
- **GIVEN** the task host has launched a language-server process, **WHEN** the LSP `initialize` response is still pending, **THEN** the current editor's status surface distinguishes the launched process from protocol readiness and shows increasing elapsed time with no ETA.
- **GIVEN** Kotlin LSP has not answered `initialize` for 60 seconds, **WHEN** the user opens its status, **THEN** the UI says initialization is taking longer than usual, identifies Gradle project import as a possible cause, keeps Stop available, and does not restart or time out the server automatically.
- **GIVEN** Kotlin LSP reports initialize work with a title, message, and percentage, **WHEN** `begin` and `report` notifications arrive, **THEN** the current editor shows the latest server text, the clamped percentage, and elapsed time while its connection continues initializing or remains ready.
- **GIVEN** a server reports an indeterminate work item, **WHEN** it omits percentage, **THEN** the UI shows activity and elapsed time without fabricating percentage or time remaining.
- **GIVEN** two work-done tokens are active, **WHEN** either token reports or ends, **THEN** only that token changes and the UI continues to show the oldest active item plus the remaining active count.
- **GIVEN** the final active token ends, **WHEN** the connection remains open, **THEN** the UI records that server-reported work finished without claiming all project references are complete.
- **GIVEN** a connection has active or completed work progress, **WHEN** it stops, crashes, retries, or is replaced, **THEN** the replacement connection starts without stale progress from the old generation.
- **GIVEN** initialize has completed and no work item is active, **WHEN** cross-file references are still missing, **THEN** the UI says the server has not reported ongoing analysis rather than labeling the condition as indexing.
- **GIVEN** a fine-pointer Monaco editor, **WHEN** the user opens the LSP status control, **THEN** an anchored popover presents connection readiness, project progress, and the available lifecycle action.
- **GIVEN** the saved LSP status location is `status_bar`, the application status bar is enabled, and a supported Monaco file is active on a fine-pointer layout, **WHEN** the editor renders, **THEN** the toolbar control is absent and one reorderable status-bar item shows that active file's language and live LSP summary.
- **GIVEN** the saved LSP status location is `status_bar`, **WHEN** the application status bar is disabled or the current Monaco layout uses a coarse pointer, **THEN** the toolbar control remains available and the saved `status_bar` preference is unchanged.
- **GIVEN** the active panel changes from a supported Monaco file to a non-file panel or unsupported file, **WHEN** the status bar is the preferred location, **THEN** the LSP status-bar item hides rather than showing another session or language.
- **GIVEN** a coarse-pointer tablet Monaco editor, **WHEN** the user taps the LSP status control, **THEN** an inset bottom drawer presents the same progress and lifecycle action with a touch-sized trigger and no document-level horizontal overflow.
- **GIVEN** an LSP server has spawned descendants, **WHEN** the task stops, **THEN** agentctl reaps the full process tree.
- **GIVEN** auto-install is downloading or running npm/Go, **WHEN** the agentctl instance is torn down, **THEN** the install is canceled and drained without publishing a partial binary or leaving descendants.
- **GIVEN** a repository contains `.kandev/lsp-servers/kotlin-lsp`, **WHEN** Kotlin LSP starts, **THEN** Kandev ignores that project-controlled executable.
- **GIVEN** a mobile viewport, **WHEN** a supported file opens, **THEN** the mobile viewer does not start an LSP process invisibly.

## Out of scope

- Remote Docker, SSH, and Sprites executor support.
- Durable per-task/session enablement and deny lists.
- Sharing one server process across browser windows.
- Rename, code actions, document symbols, formatting, and workspace-edit application.
- CodeMirror/mobile LSP parity.
- A global dashboard across every session/language connection; the application status-bar item represents only the active Monaco file.
- Estimated time remaining, predicted completion, or any guarantee that a percentage maps linearly to project readiness.
- Inferring actual indexing state, percentage, or completion from `window/logMessage`, `window/showMessage`, process output, elapsed time, or language-specific text heuristics. Elapsed time is used only to disclose that initialization is long-running.
- Request-scoped partial-result streaming, `partialResultToken`, `$/cancelRequest`, and progress cancellation.
- Bootstrapping project dependencies such as Gradle import, `npm install`, `go mod download`, or Python virtual environments.
- Replacing external editors or embedded VS Code.
