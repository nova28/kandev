# Implementation Plan: LSP Project Progress

## Overview

Extend the browser-owned LSP connection with standard work-done progress before changing the toolbar presentation. The connection generation owns all runtime progress so replacement and teardown cannot leak stale work. A shared details body then renders in an anchored fine-pointer popover or coarse-pointer tablet drawer, followed by deterministic desktop and tablet Playwright coverage.

## Backend

No backend or task-host changes are required. Both WebSocket proxy hops already forward JSON-RPC bodies unchanged.

## Frontend

### Progress contract and connection ownership

- Add `apps/web/lib/lsp/lsp-progress.ts` with pure validation and immutable transitions for `begin`, `report`, and `end` payloads.
- Extend `ManagedLspConnection` with generation-owned progress state and registered string/number tokens.
- Update `lsp-client-manager.ts` to advertise `window.workDoneProgress`, supply a client-generated initialize token, accept `window/workDoneProgress/create`, consume `$/progress`, expose a referentially stable progress snapshot, and notify subscribers.
- Clear initialization and work state on stop, idle teardown, crash, retry, or connection replacement.

### Status disclosure

- Extend `useLsp` and `useMonacoEditorLsp` to expose the current progress snapshot.
- Replace the one-click toolbar toggle with a disclosure-first `LspStatusButton`.
- Add a shared progress body that separates connection readiness from project work, renders a determinate bar only for server percentages, uses tabular elapsed time, preserves concurrent-work counts, and avoids project-wide completion claims.
- Use `useTouchDrawer`: fine pointers receive an anchored popover; coarse-pointer Monaco/tablet layouts receive an inset bottom drawer with one internal scroll owner and touch-sized controls. Phone CodeMirror viewing remains unchanged.

## Tests

- **Work progress transitions:** `apps/web/lib/lsp/lsp-progress.test.ts` covers token validation, clamping, omitted-field preservation, independent concurrent tokens, unknown/malformed payloads, completion, and reset.
- **Protocol integration:** `apps/web/lib/lsp/lsp-client-manager.test.ts` proves initialize capability/token advertisement, pre-initialize progress, server-created numeric tokens, subscriber updates, and stale-generation isolation.
- **Presentation helpers:** focused pure-helper tests cover labels, lifecycle actions, and elapsed-time formatting without adding shallow React markup tests.

## E2E Tests

- **Desktop reported progress:** extend `apps/web/e2e/tests/lsp/lsp-file-intelligence.spec.ts` and the fake server so a held initialize operation reports title, message, and percentage; verify the popover, incomplete-results warning, completion copy, and Stop action.
- **Desktop no-report fallback:** verify an initialized server that emits no work progress says so without a percentage or ETA.
- **Coarse-pointer tablet:** extend `mobile-lsp-file-intelligence.spec.ts` at tablet width to verify the same progress in a bottom drawer, a touch-sized trigger, viewport containment, and no horizontal overflow.
- Preserve the existing phone assertion that no LSP process or control starts.

## Mobile Design Contract

- **Desktop outcome:** the file-toolbar status control opens detailed connection and project-work state.
- **Mobile entry point:** phone has none because LSP remains unsupported there; a coarse-pointer tablet uses the same Monaco toolbar trigger.
- **Nearest exemplar:** `PRStatusChipDrawer` supplies the popover/drawer split, fixed drawer header, and internal scrolling geometry.
- **Hierarchy and action:** connection state first, oldest active work item second, warning and concurrent count next, one Start/Stop/Retry action last.
- **Surface:** anchored popover for fine pointers; inset bottom drawer for coarse pointers because the content is temporary status detail.
- **Geometry:** the drawer owns vertical scrolling, stays below `80dvh`, clears shared safe-area treatment, uses 44px touch controls, and does not introduce document horizontal overflow.
- **Shared logic:** one progress snapshot, formatter, and body drive both presentations.

## Risks

- LSP percentages are optional and do not represent a universal project-wide ETA.
- Servers may create several simultaneous tokens or send malformed/late frames.
- Progress can begin before the initialize response, so handlers must be installed first.
- Existing E2E flows assume clicking the toolbar control starts or stops immediately and must migrate to explicit actions.
