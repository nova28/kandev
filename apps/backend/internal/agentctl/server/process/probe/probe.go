// Package probe implements the background-workload liveness probe (spec
// docs/specs/disambiguate-waiting/spec.md, §"Background-workload liveness
// probe (agentctl)", D5/D6): given an agent process and a recorded turn
// start, it samples the agent's transitive descendant processes for one
// that started at-or-after the (truncated) turn start and is still alive.
//
// Where the descendant walk finds nothing and the platform can read another
// process's environment, it also attributes a workload that left the
// descendant tree by reparenting back to this session, by matching
// KANDEV_SESSION_ID (see docs/specs/disambiguate-waiting/requirements and
// system-design/orphaned-background-workloads.md).
